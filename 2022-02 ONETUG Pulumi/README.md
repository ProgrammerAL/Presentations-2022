# CRUD Your Cloud with C# and Pulumi

## Abstract

How do you CRUD your cloud? A lot of YAML? Some Terraform HCL sprinkled in? Maybe a few bash scripts the team is too scared to modify? Manually clicking around the portal UI? I'm betting it's a mix of different technologies no one has the time to fully learn.

Lets get together and talk about Pulumi, a tool to Create/Read/Update/Delete the cloud infrastructure services you manage. Pulumi lets you CRUD your Cloud with a handful of programming languages. But to keep things simple, we'll only use C# in this presentation.
