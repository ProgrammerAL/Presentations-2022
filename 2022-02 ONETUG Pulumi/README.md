# Infrastructure as Code in C#
# CRUD Your Cloud in C#

## Abstract

How do you CRUD your cloud? A lot of YAML? Some Terraform HCL sprinkled in? Maybe a few bash scripts the team is too scared to modify? I'm betting it's a mix of different technologies no one has the time to fully learn.

What if I told you a tool exists to Create/Read/Update/Delete the cloud infrastructure services you manage, AND it lets you use the programming language of your choice with an IDE you're already used to? Well you'd say that's crazy talk. And then I'd say no it's not. Then we'd yell over each other for an hour. Lets skip the yelling match and instead talk about Pulumi. A tool you can use to CRUD your Cloud with a handful of programming languages. But to keep things simple, we'll only use C# in this talk.
